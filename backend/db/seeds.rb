# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
#   ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror"].each do |genre_name|
#     MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)
#   end

#EqFeature.create([
#    {
#        feature_id: "test feature id 2",
#        title: "Test feature",
#        url: "Test Url",
#        magType: "Test Mag Type",
#        longitude: -104.3802,
#        latitude: 0.0,
#        time: 1710085689202,
#        place: "14 km S of Atoka, New Mexico"
